link:getting_started.html[Getting Started with Plasma]::
    The getting started guide is your first step to working with Plasma.  It
    covers installation, writing your first program, and where to look next.

link:user_guide.html[User's Guide]::
    The user's guide describes how to use the Plasma tools to work with your
    programs.

link:plasma_ref.html[Plasma Language Reference]::
    The language reference documents the language in a reference-style.
    It's useful if you want to lookup some detail.  It's not a guide and not
    ideal for teaching the language.  We have guide-like documentation other
    than the getting started guide.

link:contributing.html[Contributing to Plasma]::
    Further documentation for people interested in working on Plasma.
