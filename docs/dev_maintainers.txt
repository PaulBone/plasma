This is the maintainer's guide, it will contain procedures for maintainer's
common tasks.  However it is incomplete (Bug #48).

== Merging changes

Generally ongoing work should be done on a feature branch and merged to the
main branch.  These branches could be in ones own fork of the plasma repository
or in this one, then be merged.

At some stage we may use the bors tool to manage this for us.  For now
though it's manual.  Make the commit using:

    git commit merge --no-ff --log=999 -S branch_name

The commit message should be formatted like:

    [merge] Mutually importing modules works
    
    This patch series mainly gets mutually inclusive modules working, but
    does some other tidying up also.
   
    Fixes #123
 
    * modules:
      [compiler/pre] Save types and resources' full names
      [compiler/pre] Module qualify definitions in interface files
      [compiler/ast] Move names out of ast_resource and ast_type

A merge commit should also have some github Fixes directives.  Eg "Fixes: #123"
to say that the commits fix bug #123.  If the author of the patches already
included this directive within the patch series then it's not necessary in the
merge commit.  A pull request / patch series may fix more than one bug.

== Copyright years

At the beginning of each calendar year update the copyright statements in
the following files:
